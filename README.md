JsonLootBags
============

This mod adds JSON file based lootbags!

How it works
------------

First the easy parts:

- This bag drops it's contents on the player, so you can't exploit it for more inventory space.
- You can't tell what bag you got from looking at the item. (its not determined until you rightclick)
- The color/name of the item is closable per bag type.

Now for the complex bit:

The lootbags pick items to drop the same way a dungeon chest is filled, aka it fakes an inventory to be filled by Minecraft's WeightedRandomChestContent code.

This results in the following parameters:
- The amount of random items to be added to the 'inventory', called amountOfItemsMin & amountOfItemsMax. 
- The amount of slots in the 'inventory', called invSlotsMin & invSlotsMax.
- The array of weighted random items to pick from, with min amount, max amount & weight, called items.

A note on the amount of slots: When filling a chest, Minecraft picks a random slot to put the item in. It does not check to see if the slot is empty!
